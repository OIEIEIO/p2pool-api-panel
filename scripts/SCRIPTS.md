# Explanation:

### Initialization and Variables: 
Sets up InfluxDB URL, credentials, data directory, and cache file path.

### Infinite Loop: 
Continuously checks for new data in the blocks file.

### Data Handling: 
Reads the current data from the blocks file.
Compares it with the last cached data from last_blocks_cache.txt.
If unchanged, it skips writing to InfluxDB.
If changed, it formats the data using jq.

### Data Posting: 
Uses curl to post formatted data to InfluxDB and captures the response in response.txt.

### Cache Update: 
Updates the cache file if data is successfully written to InfluxDB.

### Sleep: 
Waits 21 seconds before the next iteration.
